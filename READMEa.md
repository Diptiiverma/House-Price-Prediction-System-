# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **machine learning model to predict house prices** based on various housing features such as location, number of rooms, and other property-related attributes. The aim is to analyze real-world housing data, identify important factors affecting house prices, and develop an accurate predictive model.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand the factors influencing house prices through data analysis
- To perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- To build and evaluate a machine learning regression model
- To predict house prices with good accuracy using advanced ML techniques

---

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains housing-related attributes and corresponding house prices
- It includes both numerical and categorical features
- The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and improve model performance

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - Pandas – data manipulation
  - NumPy – numerical computations
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization
  - Scikit-learn – data preprocessing and evaluation
  - XGBoost – regression model

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Loaded the dataset and examined its structure
   - Checked for missing values and data types

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized data distributions
   - Used correlation heatmaps to understand feature relationships

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Converted categorical variables into numerical form
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets

4. **Model Building**
   - Implemented **XGBoost Regressor** for predicting house prices

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated model performance using:
     - R² Score
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

---

## 📊 Results
- The XGBoost Regressor demonstrated strong predictive performance
- The model achieved a high R² score, indicating good fit on the data
- Error metrics showed reliable price predictions
